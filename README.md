## Description
Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Tatum Sterling, I am an aspiring full stack developer and currently working on front end development. This webpage is built with HTML and CSS only. While making this application, I learned the ins and outs of CSS and all of the possibilities CSS can offer a webpage. I hope when you view it you get a sense of my personality and ability to structure a website with those two languages.
